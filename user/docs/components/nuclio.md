# Nuclio

[Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/) is a generic purpose Serverless platform for executing and exposing statelss functions as services, run periodic Jobs etc. Nuclio is bundled with MLRun platform but may be used also indipendently offering the management capabilities both via API, CLI, and Web interfaces. It is possible to create serverless applications (deployed as Kubernetes services) using Python, Java, NodeJS, .NET Core, or shell scripts. Nuclio can therefore  be used to

- Create and expose arbitrary data services or microservices
- Expose ML Models as services through MLRun platform
- Define processors that are triggered periodically (on Cron expression) or with explicit events (e.g., attached to event-based infrastructure, like Kafka).


!!! info "How to access"

    Nuclio may be accessed from the [dashboard](dashboard.md) or from within MLRun. From its interface, you will be able to monitor and manage serverless functions grouped by projects.
