# Git best practices

Outside of test cases, projects should be backed by a Git repository, to keep track of their history.

As we've seen in the *projects* section, projects may be [created](/docs/tasks/projects/#create) with Git initialized, or [loaded](/docs/tasks/projects/#load) by cloning a repository.
