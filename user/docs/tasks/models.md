# ML Models

## Model management via UI

Models can be created and managed as *entities* with the console. You can access them from the dashboard or the left menu. You can:

- `create` a new model
- `expand` a model to see its 5 latest versions
- `show` the details of a model
- `edit` a model
- `delete` a model
- `filter` models by name and kind

We will now see how to [create](#create), [read](#read), [update](#update) and [delete](#delete) models using the UI, similarly to what is done with the SDK.
