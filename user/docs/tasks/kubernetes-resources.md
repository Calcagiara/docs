# Using Kubernetes Resources for Runs

## Managing Kubernetes Resources with SDK

With SDK you can manage Kubernetes resources for your tasks. When you run a function, you can require some Kubernetes resources for the task. Resources and data are specified in the `function.run()` method.

Please see the [Kubernetes Resources](https://scc-digitalhub.github.io/sdk-docs/runtimes/kubernetes-resources/) section of the documentation for more information.
